### Project Description 

Another framework of Java was integrated into the module which is the Liferay framework. The framework was written in Java and the project was to develop a portal with Liefray. Long story short, here is the scanerio given and a bunch of objectives to be achieved for this project.

- Developing a service portal with Liferay Framework
- Design the process to develope a portal 
- Implement a system of admin and users in the portal for management
- Insisted on using object-oriented design patterns

The project was objected to learn about the framework and how to operate within the range of availability of the framework.

### What I have done

The module is centric towards learning about Java framework and I acquired a specific knowledge about the relationships that should be implemented before the actual implementation begins and these are few things that are entailed into my accomplishments.

- Designed a class diagram for system integration
- Implemented a custom classes to support the user and admin management system
- Developed a database system with class diagram to connect it with the portal


### Language and application tools uses
- Eclipse IDE
- Lucid Chart
- Liferay Framework

### Accomplishments

At the end of the module, a fully-integrated Liferay portal was developed and the comprehension for the framework was enhanced as I've got more chance to explore more about it. Firstly, this is a class diagram that was formed to be able to lay out the format for database implementation.

**The following portal was implemented after the database was completely developed and the management of admin and user function will be seen in the below pictures.**
